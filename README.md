## Question: Create a To-Do List Application

## Objective: Build a simple To-Do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.

## Requirements:

1. HTML Structure:
   ▪ Create a basic HTML structure with an input field for adding tasks and a button to submit the task.
   ▪ Include a section to display the list of tasks.

2. JavaScript Functionality:
   ▪ When the user enters a task in the input field and clicks the "Add" button, the task should be added to the list. ▪ Each task should have:

- A checkbox to mark it as completed.
- A "Remove" button to delete the task from the list.
  ▪ When a task is marked as completed, it should visually change (e.g., strike-through text).

3. DOM Manipulation:
   ▪ Use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM to add, remove, and update tasks.
   ▪ Ensure that the application updates the displayed list without refreshing the page.

4. Styling (Optional):
   ▪ You can use basic CSS to style the application, making it user-friendly.
   Example User Interaction:
   • User types "Buy groceries" into the input field and clicks "Add".
   • The task appears in the list with a checkbox and a "Remove" button.
   • User checks the checkbox, and the task is visually marked as completed.
   • User clicks the "Remove" button, and the task is removed from the list.

Evaluation Criteria:
• Correctness: Does the application meet all requirements?
• Code Quality: Is the code clean, well-organized, and easy to read?
• DOM Manipulation: Are the DOM methods used correctly and efficiently?
• User Experience: Is the application intuitive and user-friendly?

Time Estimate:
• This task should take approximately 45 minutes to complete, including time for coding and testing the functionality.
